**service notes**

In this lab, I learned how to write a Python script to display prime numbers between 1 and 250, store them in a text file, and verify the results.
I created a Python script using Python 3, tested it, and saved it for future reference.
I also learned how to run Python scripts using Python 3 on a Linux host.
