To get to this step in the lab, I logged into the AWS Console and searched for Cloud9. I created a new Cloud9 environment by giving it a name and choosing the default settings like Amazon Linux and a t2.micro  instance. Once the setup was complete, the Cloud9 IDE opened in my browser. Now I can see the welcome screen, my project folder, and a terminal at the bottom where I can start writing and running code.

To get to this step in the lab, I opened my Cloud9 environment from the AWS Console and created a new Python file called Untitled1.py. I started editing the file in the code editor, and I could see my project folder (reStart-python-c9) on the left and the terminal at the bottom ready for commands. This setup lets me write and test Python code directly in the browser without needing to install anything on my computer.

To get to this step in the lab, I opened my Cloud9 environment and used the terminal to check which versions of Python are installed. I ran commands like python --version, python2 --version, and python3 --version to see the outputs. This helped me confirm that Python 3.8.20 is available for writing and running modern Python code, while Python 2.7.18 is also installed but mostly outdated. This step is useful to make sure I’m using the right version for my scripts.

To get to this step in the lab, I opened my Cloud9 environment and created a Python file called hello-world.py. Inside the file, I wrote a simple script that prints "Hello, World" twice. Then I ran the script using the terminal at the bottom of the IDE, and it showed the output correctly. This step helped me test that Python is working and that I can run basic code in the Cloud9 setup.
