To get to this step in the lab, I logged into the AWS Console and searched for Cloud9. I created a new Cloud9 environment by giving it a name and choosing the default settings like Amazon Linux and a t2.micro  instance. Once the setup was complete, the Cloud9 IDE opened in my browser. Now I can see the welcome screen, my project folder, and a terminal at the bottom where I can start writing and running code.

To get to this step in the lab, I opened my Cloud9 environment from the AWS Console and created a new Python file called Untitled1.py. I started editing the file in the code editor, and I could see my project folder (reStart-python-c9) on the left and the terminal at the bottom ready for commands. This setup lets me write and test Python code directly in the browser without needing to install anything on my computer.
