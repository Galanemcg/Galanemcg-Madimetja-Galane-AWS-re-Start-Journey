To get to this step in the lab, I logged into the AWS Console and searched for Cloud9. I created a new Cloud9 environment by giving it a name and choosing the default settings like Amazon Linux and a t2.micro  instance. Once the setup was complete, the Cloud9 IDE opened in my browser. Now I can see the welcome screen, my project folder, and a terminal at the bottom where I can start writing and running code.
