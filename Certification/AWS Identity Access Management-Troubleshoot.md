I completed the AWS course "Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Troubleshooting" on December 11, 2025.

This certificate confirms that:

- The course was officially recognized by AWS Training & Certification
- I learned how to troubleshoot IAM-related issues in AWS

Key skills I gained include:
- Managing who can log in to AWS
- Controlling what users and roles are allowed to do
- Fixing permission errors and access problems

This training strengthened my understanding of AWS security and access control.
