This certificate shows that I finished the AWS course called "Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Troubleshooting" on December 11, 2025. It’s signed by a director from AWS Training & Certification and proves I’ve learned how to fix IAM issues in AWS.
This course taught me how to troubleshoot issues with Identity and Access Management (IAM) — which means managing who can log in, what they can do, and how to fix permission errors in AWS.
