I completed the AWS SimuLearn: Core Security Concepts course on December 03, 2025, through AWS Training & Certification. This course helped me understand the key ideas behind securing cloud environments using AWS tools and best practices.

I learned:

- The basic principles of cloud security
- How AWS protects data and infrastructure
- How to manage access and identity securely
- How to detect and respond to security threats
- Best practices for keeping AWS environments safe
