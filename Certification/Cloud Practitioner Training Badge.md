I completed the AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner training, which is a hands-on learning experience designed to teach the basics of cloud computing using AWS.

I learned:

- What cloud computing is and how AWS supports it
- The core AWS services like EC2, S3, and IAM
- How to build simple cloud solutions in a gamified environment
- Basic concepts around security, pricing, and architecture
- How to think like a cloud practitioner and solve real-world problems
