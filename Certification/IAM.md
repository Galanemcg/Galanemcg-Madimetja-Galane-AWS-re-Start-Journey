AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Course Completion

I recently completed the Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) course on December 10, 2025, through AWS Training & Certification.

- Learned about AWS IAM and its importance in securing cloud environments
- Gained hands-on experience with:
    - Creating and managing IAM users and groups
    - Setting permissions using IAM policies
    - Using IAM roles for temporary access
- Covered best practices for keeping AWS accounts secure

This course has helped me build my cloud skills and prepare for future AWS certifications. I'm excited to apply my knowledge and continue learning
