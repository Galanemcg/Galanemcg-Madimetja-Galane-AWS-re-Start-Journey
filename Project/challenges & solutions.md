**challenges**

1. Manual order tracking system: The restaurant uses a manual system (e.g., paper-based or basic spreadsheet tracking) for managing orders, both in-person and via phone or email.
2. Frequent mix-ups and confusion: The current manual system leads to frequent mix-ups, double-booked bookings, and the owner struggles to track customer preferences or confirmations.
3. No cloud migration: The restaurant has not migrated to the cloud and relies on manual or on-premises systems (e.g., paper records or a local computer) to manage bookings and orders.
4. Operational inefficiencies: This leads to operational inefficiencies like wrong dishes, delays in confirming customer requests, and making it hard for the owner to track customer data.
5. Costly and time-consuming to manage orders or upgrade: Scaling the current system to handle more customers is costly and time-consuming, requiring more staff to manage orders or upgrading on-premises hardware.


**solution**

1. Implement a digital order management system: Transition from a manual system to a digital order management system that can handle in-person, phone, and email orders efficiently.
2. Migrate to cloud-based systems: Move the restaurant's systems to the cloud to improve scalability, reduce costs, and enhance accessibility.
3. Use a simple static website for bookings setup: Implement a simple static website to allow customers to make bookings and improve efficiency.
4. Automate tracking and confirmations: Use digital tools to automate tracking of orders, bookings, and confirmations to reduce mix-ups and improve customer experience.
5. Improve scalability with cloud services: Leverage AWS services (as mentioned in the context) to address the restaurant's needs, such as using AWS for hosting a website, managing data, and scaling according to demand.
