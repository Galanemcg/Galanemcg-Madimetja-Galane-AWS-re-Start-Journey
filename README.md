# AWS Cloud Practitioner Journey

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Practitioner learning repository!

I’m Madimetja Charles Galane, an Electrical Engineer / Electrical Artisan who is currently upskilling through the AWS re/Start Programme with Praesignis.  
I’m passionate about cloud computing and continuous learning. This space documents my progress, notes, and hands-on labs as I build my foundational skills in Amazon Web Services (AWS).  
Coming from an engineering background, I bring a practical mindset and strong technical experience into the world of cloud architecture.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Organized Notes by Module  
- Hands-on Lab Documentation  
- Helpful Learning Resources  
- Reflections from my learning journey  

## Modules Covered

### Compute  
Compute is the processing power for applications.  
Examples I worked with: EC2 (virtual servers), Lambda (serverless functions)  
It helps apps run smoothly and scale when needed.

### Networking  
Networking connects AWS resources securely.  
Examples I used: VPC, Route 53  
It controls how resources talk to each other and how traffic flows.

### Storage  
Storage is where I keep data, files, and backups.  
Examples I used: S3, EBS  
It’s important for keeping data safe and available.

### Databases  
Databases store structured application data.  
Examples I worked with: RDS, DynamoDB  
They help apps access data quickly and reliably.

### Security  
I used IAM to control access.  
I learned about roles, policies, MFA, and basic encryption.  
Security protects resources and keeps data safe.

### EC2 Web Server Lab  
I launched an EC2 instance, configured security groups, connected via SSH, and hosted a basic web page.

### AWS Lex Bot  
TBD  
I will include intents, bot logic, and usage screenshots.

## Labs

I completed a minimum of two labs per section (Compute, Storage, Networking, Databases).  
Each lab is documented with clear explanations, screenshots, and reasons for every step I took.

## My Background

I am an Electrical Engineer / Electrical Artisan with strong experience in electrical systems, safety compliance, and infrastructure maintenance.  
I am currently unemployed but actively learning cloud computing through AWS re/Start.  
This repository is part of my journey to transition into cloud architecture and build a new career path.
