# AWS Cloud Practitioner Journey

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Practitioner learning repository!

I’m **Madimetja Charles Galane**, an Electrical Engineer / Electrical Artisan currently upskilling through the **AWS re/Start Programme** with Praesignis.  
I’m passionate about cloud computing and continuous learning. This space documents my progress, notes, and hands-on labs as I build my foundational skills in Amazon Web Services (AWS).  
Coming from an engineering background, I bring a practical mindset and strong technical experience into the world of cloud architecture.
