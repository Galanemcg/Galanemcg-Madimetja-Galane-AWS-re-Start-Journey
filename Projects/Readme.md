3. IAM Security Training Chatbot – Cloud Learners Inc.
A serverless chatbot built to teach AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) through scenario-based quizzes.

Overview

Built with Amazon Lex V2 (conversation layer) and AWS Lambda (business logic)

Designed to help students safely learn IAM concepts before applying them in production environments

Deployed in Cape Town (af-south-1), English (ZA)

Why IAM?

40% of cloud breaches stem from IAM misconfigurations

Every AWS user interacts with IAM daily

Common confusion points: Users vs Roles, Authentication vs Authorization, Over-permissioning

Architecture

Amazon Lex V2 for natural language processing

AWS Lambda for branching quiz logic

CloudWatch for monitoring and debugging

Key Differentiator  
Scenario-based questions (e.g., “Your EC2 needs S3 access. IAM User or Role?”) with real-world consequences explained for wrong answers.

Challenges & Solutions

Lambda permission errors → fixed with resource-based policies

Input handling → regex normalization for conversational answers

Response formatting → improved readability with separators and headers
