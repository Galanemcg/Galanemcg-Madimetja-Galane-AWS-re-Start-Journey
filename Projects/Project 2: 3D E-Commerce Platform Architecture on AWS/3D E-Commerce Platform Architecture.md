# **3D E-Commerce Architecture on AWS**

## Scenario  

I am part of a startup team working on a next-generation 3D e-commerce web application.  
This platform will let users interact with 3D models of products such as furniture, gadgets, and fashion items before making a purchase.  

The application is expected to serve millions of users worldwide, so it must be:  
- Fast  
- Highly available  
- Secure  
- Cost-efficient

## My Role  

As a Cloud Practitioner, my responsibility is to design the cloud architecture using AWS services to support this 3D application and meet both business and technical requirements.  

---

## Key AWS Services Considered  

- **Compute**: EC2, Lambda, ECS/EKS for scalable and flexible workloads  
- **Storage & Delivery**: S3 for assets, CloudFront for global content delivery, EFS for shared storage  
- **Database**: DynamoDB for product catalogs, RDS for transactional data  
- **Networking & Availability**: Elastic Load Balancer, Route 53, Multi-AZ deployments  
- **Security**: IAM, WAF, Shield, and KMS for encryption  
- **Monitoring & Cost Optimization**: CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor, Auto Scaling  

---

## Expected Outcomes  

- Smooth 3D product interaction for users worldwide  
- Scalable and resilient system to handle traffic spikes  
- Secure handling of transactions and user data  
- Optimized costs through serverless and auto-scaling solutions
