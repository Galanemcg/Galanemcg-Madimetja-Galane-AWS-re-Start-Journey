# **3D E-Commerce Architecture on AWS**

## Scenario  

I am part of a startup team working on a next-generation 3D e-commerce web application.  
This platform allows users to interact with 3D models of products such as furniture, gadgets, and fashion items before making a purchase.  

The application is expected to serve millions of users worldwide, so it must be:  
- Fast  
- Highly available  
- Secure  
- Cost-efficient  

---

## My Role  

As a Cloud Practitioner, my responsibility is to design the cloud architecture using AWS services to support this 3D application and meet both business and technical requirements.  

---

## Key AWS Services Considered  

- **Compute**: EC2, Lambda, ECS/EKS for scalable and flexible workloads  
- **Storage & Delivery**: S3 for assets, CloudFront for global content delivery, EFS for shared storage  
- **Database**: DynamoDB for product catalogs, RDS for transactional data  
- **Networking & Availability**: Elastic Load Balancer, Route 53, Multi-AZ deployments  
- **Security**: IAM, WAF, Shield, and KMS for encryption  
- **Monitoring & Cost Optimization**: CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor, Auto Scaling

## Problem  

The challenge was to design a cloud architecture that could handle millions of users interacting with 3D models in real time. The system needed to be fast, secure, globally available, and cost-efficient while supporting heavy workloads.  

---

## Solution  

By integrating and optimizing AWS services, we created a modern architecture that:  
- Delivers 3D content quickly through CloudFront and S3  
- Scales automatically with EC2, Lambda, and Auto Scaling  
- Ensures high availability with Route 53 and Multi-AZ deployments  
- Protects user data with IAM, WAF, Shield, and KMS  
- Monitors performance and costs with CloudWatch and Trusted Advisor

## What I Have Learned  

This project taught me how to:  
- Integrate different AWS services to solve complex technical challenges  
- Design a highly available and scalable cloud application  
- Balance performance, security, and cost-efficiency in a global platform  
- Apply cloud best practices to real-world business needs  

---

## Expected Outcomes  

- Smooth 3D product interaction for users worldwide  
- Scalable and resilient system to handle traffic spikes  
- Secure handling of transactions and user data  
- Optimized costs through serverless and auto-scaling solutions
